# Business Problems and Data Science Solutions
##Supervised versus unsupervised methods
- Unsupervised: no specific purpose or target has been specified
- Supervised: aiming towards a purpose (condition: there must be data on the target, if data missing or incomplete, the target value cannot be provided).
  --Classification: usually involves a categorical target, example: will this customer purchase service if given incentive x? Which service package will a customer likely purchase if given incentive x?
  --Regression: usually involves a numeric target, example: How much will this customer use the service?
  --Sometimes we want a numerical prediction over a categorical target, this is called 'Class probability estimation', example: model the probability that the customer will continue.
- The vital part in the early stage of data mining process: decide whether the line of attack will be supervised or unsupervised, and if supervides, to produce a precise defination of a target variable.

##Data mining and its results
- Mining the data to find patterns and build models
- Using the results of data mining

##Process of data mining
- Business understanding: how to translate business problems into ds problems --> classification, class probablility estimation ,regression, similarity match, clustering (similarity between objects based on the objects' attributes), co-occurrence grouping (co-occurence in transactions), 
- Data understanding: Understand the strengths and limitations of the data; Estimating the costs and benefits of each data source and deciding whether further investment is merited.
- Data Preparation
- Data Modeling: More chapters on this, skimmed here
- Evaluation 
- Deployment

##Business questions examples to be answered by different techniques
- Who are the most profitable customers? Database queries.
- Is there really a difference between the profitable customer and the average customer? Statistical hypothesis testings - p=? that this is due to random chance.
- But who really are these customers? Can I characterize them? Characteristics of individual customers can be extracted from a database, but the analysis to figure out pattern is data science.
- Will some particular new customer be profitable? How much revenue should I expect this customer to generate? Should be addressed by data mining techniques that examine historical customer records and produce predictive models of profitability.

#Predictive Modeling: From Correlation to Supervised Segmentation
- An intuitive way of thinking about extracting patterns from data in a supervised manner is to try to segment the population into subgroups that have different values for the target variable.
- BUT, usually we have MANY attributes, and not sure exactly what the segments should be. Ideally we would want to extract the most important variables automatically. Unfortunately in reall data we seldom expect to find a variable that will make the segments pure.
- We can create a formula that evaluates how well each attributes splits a set of examples into segments, with repsect to a chosen target variable ---> purity measure. One of the splitting citerion is called information gain, which is based on a purity measure called entropy.
- Entropy=-p1log(p1)-p2log(p2)-...each pi is the probability(the relative percentage) of property i within the set, ranging from pi=1 when all members of the set have property i, and pi = 0 when no members
of the set have property i. The … simply indicates that there may be more than just two
properties .
- Example: As a concrete example, consider a set S of 10 people with seven of the non-write-off class
and three of the write-off class. So:
p(non-write-off) = 7 / 10 = 0.7
p(write-off) = 3 / 10 = 0.3
entropy(S) = [- 0.7 × log2
(0.7) + 0.3 × log2
(0.3)]
≈ -[0.7 × - 0.51 + 0.3 × - 1.74]
≈ 0.88
